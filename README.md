# groupi-tracker

Objectives
Groupie Trackers consists of receiving a given API and manipulating the data contained in it in order to create a website displaying the information.

You will be given an API, that is made up of four parts:

artists: Contains information about some bands and artists like their name(s), image, in which year they began their activity, the date of their first album and the members.

locations: Contains their last and/or upcoming concert locations.

dates: Contains their last and/or upcoming concert dates.

relation: Links the data of all the other parts, artists, dates and locations.

Given all this, you should build a user-friendly website where you can display the band's info through several data visualizations (examples : blocks, cards, tables, lists, pages, graphics, etc). It is up to you to decide how you will display it.

This project also focuses on the creation and visualization of events/actions.

The event/action you need to implement is a client call to the server (client-server). We can say that it is a feature of your choice that needs to trigger an action. This action necessitates communication with the server in order to receive information (request-response).

An event consists of a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.

Instructions
The backend must be written in Go.

The website and server cannot crash at any time.

All the pages must work correctly, and you must take care of any errors.

The code must respect the good practices.

It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.

Allowed packages
Only the standard Go packages are allowed.

Usage
You can see an example of a RESTful API here

This project will help you learn about:

Manipulation and storage of data.

JSON files and format.

HTML.

Event creation and visualization.

Client-server.
